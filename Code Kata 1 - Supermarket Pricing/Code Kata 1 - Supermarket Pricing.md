In this kata:

Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: a can of beans costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. 

For example:
- three for a dollar (so what’s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
- $1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
- buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)

This kata involves no coding. The exercise is to experiment with various models for representing money and prices that are flexible enough to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes, and at the same time are generally usable (at the checkout, for stock management, order entry, and so on). Spend time considering issues such as:

- does fractional money exist?
- when (if ever) does rounding take place?
- how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
- are costs and prices the same class of thing?
- if a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?

PERSONAL SOLUTION

[X] Get a real catalog of pricing in a supermarket
    - Walmart is probably the biggest retailer in US so we could use a sample from one of their
    bigger stores(to get more variety in pricing)
    - Got the black-friday-2019 ad from https://www.bradsdeals.com/black-friday/walmart

[] Check all the different ways things are priced and what could affect the pricing
    [] Group them according to how similar they seem
    [] Assign names to them and the kind of data involved

[] Start thinking of a way to represent the prices  
    [] What scheme will we use? based on complexity of pricing? type of product? ...?

[] Test, iterate and improve process to a statisfactory threshold
